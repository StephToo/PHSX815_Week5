HOMEWORK 5
This python code contains both parts of the assignment.

The first uses rejection sampling and pdf functions in order to get close to the target function using a proposal pdf

The paramaters a,b and the number of samples n can be modified directly in the python file
The results are plotted, but the proposal pdf is giving me trouble


The second part of the code uses rejection samplibg to random points on a 2D epsilloid

the values of a,b parameters and min and max of x and y can be modified directly


HOMEWORK 6
I integrated using mixed intervals and gaussian quad
